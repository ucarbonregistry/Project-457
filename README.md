_______________
The project activity is a waste heat recovery power generation activity which incorporates
installation and operation of waste heat recovery boiler (WHRB) having capacity of 10 MW
manufactured and supplied Thermax Limited Project respectively in district Jamnagar of the state of
Gujarat in India. This project has been promoted by M/s Shreeji Coke and Energy Pvt. Ltd.
The Coke Oven Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) Boiler system, where hot flue gases from coke oven
batteries are directed through the boiler and connected to an MS/RCC chimney via an ID fan. The
boiler is a two-pass natural circulation type, with the first pass housing radiation sections, screens,
super heaters, and evaporators, and the second pass containing an economizer within a steel casing.
Soot blowers are included to clean the heating surfaces, especially due to the sticky nature of coke
oven gas dust. Insulation is provided to minimize heat loss and maintain surface temperatures 20Â°C
above ambient. Additionally, refractory materials are used from the coke oven battery outlet to the
boiler inlet, and dampers are installed for isolation during normal operations and shutdowns.
The WHRB under the project activity was commissioned on 26/05/2022 by Gujarat Energy
Transmission Corporation Limited (GETCO), Government of Gujarat, India.

As per the ex-ante estimate, the project will generate approximately 36078 MWh per Annum of
electricity per annum. The net generated electricity from the project activity is used for captive
consumption by the project proponent (PP). The project activity has been helping in greenhouse gas
(GHG) emission reduction by using manufacturing industries sectoral scope of waste heat recovery
for generating cleaner power using boiler & turbine.

The estimated annual average and the total CO2e emission reduction by the project activity is
expected to be 32470 tCO2e, whereas actual emission reduction achieved during the first CoU period
shall be submitted as a part of first monitoring and verification.
Since the project activity generates electricity through WHRB, a clean energy source it will not cause
any negative impact on the environment and thereby contributes to climate change mitigation efforts.
